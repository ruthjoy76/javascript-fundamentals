### An Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
- "LiveScript"
- ECMAScript

### How to Run JavaScript Code?

### Variables

- are used to store information / a "named storage" for data
- An online shop ==> the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart
- A chat application ==> the information might include users, messages, and much more.

#### Limitations when naming variables in JavaScript

1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and \_.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

- let ==> is a modern variable declaration
- var ==> is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all.
- const ==> is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.

#### Exercises

1. Working with variables

- Declare two variables: admin and name.
- Assign the value "John" to name.
- Copy the value from name to admin.
- Show the value of admin using alert.

2. Giving the right name

- Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
- Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

3. Examine the following code:

const birthday = '18.04.1982';

const age = console.log(birthday);

### Numbers

- are the building blocks of programming logic
- +, -, \*, /, \*\*, %, ++, --
- assignment (=), equality (==), strict equality (===)
